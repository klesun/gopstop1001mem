# gopstop1001mem
Interface to 1001mem.ru content with nice filters

The aim of this project was to crawl and filter out stupid posts from https://1001mem.ru and https://memebase.cheezburger.com/ and show you only best of the best of the best of them. 

If I'm not mistaken there was also a button to rate them yourself. I remember scrolling through this stuff in a train a lot, oh these good old times of youth...

The graph below shows the id on X axis and the amount of upvotes on the Y axis.
